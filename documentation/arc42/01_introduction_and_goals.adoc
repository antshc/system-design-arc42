== Introduction and Goals
The purpose of this document is to describe the architecture of a highly scalable image-sharing platform that allows users to upload, store, and share images with others across the globe. The platform needs to handle millions of concurrent users while ensuring high availability, performance, and security.

This document provides a high-level overview of the platform’s architecture, its main components, and the underlying technologies used to meet business and technical requirements. Additionally, it outlines key design decisions that influence the system’s scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

This document is intended for developers, architects, DevOps engineers, and other stakeholders involved in the design, implementation, and maintenance of the platform.

=== Goals
* The platform should provide a responsive and intuitive user interface that works seamlessly across different devices (web, mobile, etc.).
* The architecture should be designed with cloud-native principles to optimize operational costs, using autoscaling and serverless services where appropriate.
* The platform should be built with future feature expansion in mind, allowing for easy addition of new services (e.g., image editing, tagging, or machine learning features like image recognition).

=== Requirements Overview

.RQ1: When a user registers, they provide:
* Mandatory: First name, Last name, Email address, Password, Profile Image
* Optional: age, location, interests etc ...
 
.RQ2: Users can share only images
* Formats: png, jpeg
* Sizes: 320x240, 1024x768

.RQ3: Unidirectional relationship
* User A follows User B
*User B may/may not follow User A

.RQ4 A User can:         
* Post a new image
* Search for other users by first name/last name/username
* view other user's public info and shared images
* Follow/unfollow other users
* See a personalized timeline/newsfeed of the latest images, posted by people they follow
** The images need to be in the chronological order  
 
.Out of Scope
* Adding new formats like txt or videos should be easy to add in the future.
* A User can:
** Add reactions, comments, sharing etc..


=== Quality Goals

[cols="5*", options="header"]
|===
| ID | Quality Category   | Quality  | Description | Scenario

| QGS1
| Scalability
| Users visits
a| 
.Billions of active users (~1-2 Billion)
* Hundreds of millions of visits/day (100-500 Million)
|

| QGS2
| Scalability
| Users activity
a| 
.Each user uploads ~1 image/day
* Each image size ~2MB
* Data Processing Volume: ~1PB/day
|

| QGS3
| Scalability        
| Dynamic Scaling  
| The system should scale out when user activity increases without performance degradation and scale down when no activity. 
| 

| QGS4
| Scalability        
| Geographic Distribution 
| The application should be accessible with minimal latency in the europe regions through data centers or edge servers.
| 

| QGR1
| Reliability
| Minimizes downtime 
| The system must be designed to ensure minimal downtime, providing a 99.9% availability SLA.
|

| QGR2
| Reliability        
| Fault Tolerance        
| Maintains service continuity despite failures. In case of a node failure, the system should redistribute load seamlessly, avoiding disruptions.         
| 

| QGR3
| Reliability        
| Minimizes downtime       
| In the event of a regional disaster, the system should recover instantly with zero downtime.       
| 

| QGP1
| Performance
| Low Latency
a| 
.Response time
* get images, search user <500ms at 99pt
* download image of size 2mb ~2000 ms
* Timeline/Newsfeed load time < 1000ms at 99pt

.Out of scope
* Uploads and downloads of images must be fast and efficient, with minimal latency, even under heavy loads.
|

| QGP2
| Performance        
| High Throughput        
| The system should support up to 10,000 concurrent requests per second, especially during peak hours.           
| 

| QGSEC1
| Security
| Access Control         
a| 
* Limits access for functionality to authorized users only. 
* Only authenticated and authorized users can access specific features like posting content, following other users. 
* Un authorized users can view limited timeline.          
| 

| QGS2
| Security           
| Data Encryption        
| Protects sensitive data both in transit and at rest. User credentials and personal information should be encrypted to ensure privacy and comply with data regulations.      
| 

| QGP1
| Portability
| User Interfaces        
| Support only web interface       
| 

| QGM1
| Maintainability
| Modular Design       
a| 
* The system should be easy to modify and extend.
* Allowing multiple independent teams to work on different modules simultaneously without conflicts. 
* Supports isolated updates and bug fixes. Changes, such as bug fixes, feature enhancements, or performance improvements, should be implemented quickly with minimal impact on other components.      
| 

| QGM2
| Maintainability 
| Automated Testing
| Validates system functionality with each deployment. Automated integration and regression tests should run for each deployment to reduce the risk of introducing errors or breaking functionality.
| 

| QGM3
| Maintainability 
| Teams Scalability
| Enables multiple teams to work on the system simultaneously without dependencies that cause delays. The architecture should support decoupled microservices, allowing teams to deploy and update their services independently.
| 

| QGC1
| Compatibility 
| Backward Compatibility
| Supports multiple API versions and maintains backward compatibility with existing clients. The system should allow existing clients to function without breaking when new API versions are introduced.
| 

| QGCE1
| Cost Efficiency 
| Storage Optimization
| Reduces storage space usage to minimize costs.
