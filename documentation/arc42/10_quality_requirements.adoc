| ID | Quality Category   | Quality  | Description | Scenario

| QGS2
| Scalability
| Users activity
a| 
.Each user uploads ~1 image/day
* Each image size ~2MB
* Data Processing Volume: ~1PB/day
|

| QGR2
| Reliability        
| Fault Tolerance        
| Maintains service continuity despite failures. In case of a failure, the system should redistribute load seamlessly, avoiding disruptions.         
| 

| QGP1
| Performance
| Low Latency
a| 
.Response time
* get images, search user <500ms at 99pt
* download image of size 2mb ~2000 ms
* Timeline/Newsfeed load time < 1000ms at 99pt

.Out of scope
* Uploads and downloads of images must be fast and efficient, with minimal latency, even under heavy loads.
|

| QGP2
| Performance        
| High Throughput        
| The system should support up to 10,000 concurrent requests per second, especially during peak hours.           
| 

| QGSEC1
| Security
| Access Control         
a| 
* Limits access for functionality to authorized users only. 
* Only authenticated and authorized users can access specific features like posting content, following other users. 
* Un authorized users can view limited timeline.          
| 

| QGS2
| Security           
| Data Encryption        
| Protects sensitive data both in transit and at rest. User credentials and personal information should be encrypted to ensure privacy and comply with data regulations.      
| 

| QGP1
| Portability
| User Interfaces        
| Support only web interface       
| 

| QGM2
| Maintainability 
| Automated Testing
| Validates system functionality with each deployment. Automated integration and regression tests should run for each deployment to reduce the risk of introducing errors or breaking functionality.
| 

| QGM3
| Maintainability 
| Teams Scalability
| Enables multiple teams to work on the system simultaneously without dependencies that cause delays. The architecture should support decoupled microservices, allowing teams to deploy and update their services independently.
| 

| QGC1
| Compatibility 
| Backward Compatibility
| Supports multiple API versions and maintains backward compatibility with existing clients. The system should allow existing clients to function without breaking when new API versions are introduced.
