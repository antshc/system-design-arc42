| Risk ID | Risk Description                     | Mitigation Strategy

| R1      
| High load from influencers causing performance degradation due to large-scale timeline updates. 
| Implement a separate materialized view for influencer posts to reduce load on the main timeline. Use caching and batch processing.

| R2     
| Dependency on external APIs, leading to potential service disruptions if APIs are down. 
| Use local caching and circuit breakers to handle temporary outages and minimize the impact on users.

| R3    
| Cost overruns due to high storage and compute needs as the system scales. 
| Optimize storage through data compression, archiving, and implement auto-scaling to manage resources dynamically.

| R4   
| Inconsistent data updates due to eventual consistency in microservices. 
| Use idempotent operations and reconcile data periodically to ensure consistency across services.

| R5     
| Risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. 
| Enforce strong access controls, data encryption, and multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.

| R6    
| Outdated data in influencer timelines due to cache staleness. 
| Set appropriate cache expiration times and implement cache invalidation strategies to keep data fresh.

== Technical Debts

[cols="1,3,4", options="header"]
|===
| Debt ID | Technical Debt Description             | Impact and Remediation Strategy

| TD1     
| Lack of centralized logging system for monitoring and troubleshooting. 
| Makes debugging across services difficult. Remediate by implementing a centralized logging solution such as Azure Application Insights or ELK Stack.

| TD2     
| Incomplete API versioning, leading to backward compatibility issues. 
| Causes disruptions for clients using older API versions. Remediate by adopting consistent API versioning and supporting multiple versions.

| TD3     
| Insufficient automated tests for microservices. 
| Leads to increased risk of errors during deployment. Remediate by developing automated test suites covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

| TD4    
| Hard-coded configurations across services. 
| Reduces flexibility in deployment and configuration management. Remediate by using a centralized configuration management tool, like Azure App Configuration.

| TD5     
| Inconsistent error handling and retry mechanisms in services. 
| Leads to unpredictable behavior during failures. Remediate by standardizing error handling and retry policies across services.

| TD6    
| Limited resilience testing for failure scenarios (e.g., network partitions). 
| Increases the risk of unexpected downtime. Remediate by conducting regular chaos engineering exercises to test service resilience.

| TD7  
| No clear deprecation policy for obsolete services or APIs. 
| Results in bloated codebase and confusion among developers. Remediate by establishing a deprecation policy with clear timelines for phasing out outdated services or versions.
