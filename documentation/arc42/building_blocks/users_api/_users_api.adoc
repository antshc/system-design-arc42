==== Users API

The Users API microservice is responsible for managing all user-related functionality within the system. 
Its primary purpose is to handle operations such as user registration, authentication, profile management, and account settings. 
It also manages user data, including personal information, preferences, and security features like password updates and account recovery.

===== Quality/Performance Characteristics
====== Performance
* Aim for responses within 200 milliseconds.
* Support several thousand requests per second (RPS) during peak times.
* Minimize network latency with efficient API calls and lightweight data formats.

====== Scalability
* Design to add more instances as user demand increases.
* Distribute requests evenly across multiple API instances.

====== Reliability
* Target 99.9% uptime with redundancy and failover strategies.
* Ensure limited functionality in case of partial failures.

===== Fulfilled Requirements
* Users can create accounts by providing necessary details (username, email, password).
* Users can log in using their credentials, receiving an access token for subsequent requests.
* Users can view and update their profile information (e.g., username, bio).
* All sensitive user data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
* The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.


===== Risks
* Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) regarding user data handling and storage.
* Risks of unauthorized access or data breaches if security measures are not adequately implemented.
* Reliance on third-party authentication providers could lead to outages or service interruptions.
* Complexity in the registration or authentication process may lead to user drop-off.
