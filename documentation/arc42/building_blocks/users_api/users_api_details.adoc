===== Quality/Performance Characteristics
====== Performance
* **Response Time**: Aim for responses within 200 milliseconds.
* **Throughput**: Support several thousand requests per second (RPS) during peak times.
* **Latency**: Minimize network latency with efficient API calls and lightweight data formats.

====== Scalability
* **Horizontal Scalability**: Design to add more instances as user demand increases.
* **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests evenly across multiple API instances.

====== Reliability
* **High Availability**: Target 99.9% uptime with redundancy and failover strategies.
* **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure limited functionality in case of partial failures.


===== Fulfilled Requirements
* **User Registration**: Users can create accounts by providing necessary details (username, email, password).
* **User Authentication**: Users can log in using their credentials, receiving an access token for subsequent requests.
* **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profile information (e.g., username, bio).
* **Password Recovery**: Users can initiate a password reset process via email.
* **User Data Security**: All sensitive user data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
* **Rate Limiting**: The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
* **Versioning**: The API supports versioning to maintain backward compatibility.
* **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear and detailed API documentation is provided for developers.

===== Open Issues/Problems/Risks
* **Data Privacy Concerns**: Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) regarding user data handling and storage.
* **Scalability Challenges**: Potential difficulties in scaling the API efficiently to handle sudden increases in user demand.
* **Security Vulnerabilities**: Risks of unauthorized access or data breaches if security measures are not adequately implemented.
* **Dependency Management**: Reliance on third-party authentication providers could lead to outages or service interruptions.
* **User Experience Issues**: Complexity in the registration or authentication process may lead to user drop-off.
* **Performance Bottlenecks**: Risk of slow response times or degraded performance during peak usage periods.
* **Integration Challenges**: Difficulties in integrating with existing systems or services that rely on user data.
* **Documentation Gaps**: Incomplete or unclear API documentation may hinder developer adoption and usage.
