==== Users API
include::_users_api_short_description.adoc[]

===== Quality/Performance Characteristics
====== Performance
* Aim for responses within 200 milliseconds.
* Support several thousand requests per second (RPS) during peak times.
* Minimize network latency with efficient API calls and lightweight data formats.

====== Scalability
* Design to add more instances as user demand increases.
* Distribute requests evenly across multiple API instances.

====== Reliability
* Target 99.9% uptime with redundancy and failover strategies.
* Ensure limited functionality in case of partial failures.

===== Fulfilled Requirements
* Users can create accounts by providing necessary details (username, email, password).
* Users can log in using their credentials, receiving an access token for subsequent requests.
* Users can view and update their profile information (e.g., username, bio).
* All sensitive user data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
* The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.


===== Risks
* Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) regarding user data handling and storage.
* Risks of unauthorized access or data breaches if security measures are not adequately implemented.
* Reliance on third-party authentication providers could lead to outages or service interruptions.
* Complexity in the registration or authentication process may lead to user drop-off.
